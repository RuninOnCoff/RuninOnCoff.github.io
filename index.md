## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 4, Part 1

I had a lot of fun creating the equation to work like a calculator in the first part of the lab. It was frustrating because my lab partner and I would get really close and then run the program but it would be just a tad bit off. This made it more encouraging to keep going because we were almost there. When we finally got the code to work and behave in the right way it was so exciting. In this lab, aside from persistence, we learned the way that coding can apply to the real world situations and more about just how much work goes on behind the scenes.

*Lab 12, Part 1

The first part of lab 12 was very interesting and overall fun to work on. It was so cool to see how code in words and color names can create such a great image. It was more difficult for me but my partner made sure I still felt included and I appreciated that. This was the last lab we worked on and it was so pleasant to see the final result. 

*Lab 7

Lab 7 was one of my top three favorite labs because it was one of the few that only had one part in them. The purpose of the lab was to use our programming skills to validate command lines and create certain outputs when there was an incorrect input. It was really fun however to be so confused as a class and all scramble around to decode the instructions in the signs.
